# Enzyme-Project
## Intro: 
enzyme reaction is a special kind among chemistry reactions

## Dataset Resource:
1. **BRENDA** is the main collection of enzyme functional data available to the scientific community which gives a representative overview on the characteristics and variability of each enzyme. It is available free of charge via the internet (www.brenda-enzymes.org). The enzymes are classified according to the Enzyme Commission list of enzymes. Up to the newest release in January, 2024, Enzymes from 8476 different EC numbers are covered. Frequently enzymes with very different properties are included under the same EC number. The number of effective ones for our work is 7931.

2. **BioCyc** is a database collection and website that couples rich and high-quality data with extensive bioinformatics tools. The BioCyc collection of Pathway/Genome Databases (PGDBs) provides a reference on the genomes, metabolic pathways, and (in some cases) regulatory networks of thousands of sequenced organisms.
   
   (1) Escherichia coli K-12 substr. MG1655: The free EcoCyc DB is the result of more than 20 person-years of effort to enter information from 44,000+ E. coli articles about gene function, metabolism, transport, and regulatory processes. Here reactions of 1453 kinds of enzymes in Escherichia coli K-12 substr. MG1655 are provided.\
   (2) Arthrospira platensis NIES-39: This Pathway/Genome Database (PGDB) was generated on 01-June-2020 from the annotated genome of Arthrospira platensis NIES-39, as obtained from RefSeq (see the RefSeq entry for the authors of the original genome sequence). The PGDB was created computationally by the PathoLogic component of the Pathway Tools software (version 24.5) [Karp16, Karp11] using MetaCyc version 24.1 [Caspi20]. It has not undergone any manual curation or review, and may contain errors. Development of this PGDB was supported by grant GM080746 from the National Institutes of Health. Here reactions of 916 kinds of enzymes in Arthrospira platensis NIES-39 are provided.
